# Hi 😄

I'm a Startup Founder & Creative Engineer @ [Enable](https://enableu.ai), a digital product development startup focused on building physical products using additive manufacturing techniques geared for minimal viable products, small and large scale production.

I'm obessed with all things 3-D Printing/Modeling/Design/Art.

I also write and create various types of content across [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamdavidlevai), [YouTube](https://dvdlv.me), [Medium](https://medium.com/@hjcbr19), and this blog about **All Things Additive.**

I've been working with CAD since I was a teenager. I started as a mechanical drafter and quickly learned AutoCAD, Inventor and later Solidworks, Creo Parametric and Fusion 360. During university, I have worked as a mechanical design engineer and senior product development engineer at both startup and large companies.

Fast forward to 2022, I decided to use this knowledge to start a company focused on creating products primarily using additive manufacturing, with the intent for small or large scale production.

## What's the point of this site?

- I don't see a place where Functional 3D Printing exists. I want to build a case for it in the public eye because there are incredible feats being accomplished using 3D Printing that is revolutionizing all industries.
- To inspire other people to create products using additive manufacturing.
- To teach others design for manufacturing, 3D Printing, design.techniques and other cool projects other's have worked on.
- To bring functional 3D Printing to the general public. Cool toys and gadgets are awesome but functional products that can impact society is incredible.
- I think by sharing my journey will inspire others to share theirs too.

**Feel free to reach out to me anytime, I'd love to chat! Not just about additive but anything that peaks your creative curiosity!**

## Why Additive?

The future of manufacturing is additive. Complex design and rise in material cost can be mitigated by using additive manufacturing. No need for expensive one-offs from traditional manufacturing.

My biggest goal is to enable people to create products that can solve complex solutions and bring more awareness to additive manufacturing.

## What can you find here?

A lot of content, **that is absolutely free.** This includes:

- Case Studies
- Projects
- Essays
- Technique tips on design and 3D Printing
- Functional 3D Printing Breakdowns and Guides
- Industry Experience (From my past lives and others)

## What am I doing besides this?

When I'm not creating content, or building a startup, I am a avid healthy lifestyle freak who competes in olympic weightlifting in the 96kg category. Shout out to the corrupt IWF for getting the sport removed from the Olympics forever 🤦🏽.

**My background as an Engineer:** Graduated with a B.S./M.S. in Biomedical Engineering. 5 Years of experience in two startup companies and two large medical device companies including a startup pharmaceutical company that created 3D printed tablets for patients suffering from pill burden and dysphagia.

**My background in 3D Printing:** Started using CAD since I was in 9th grade and self taught in 3D modeling software such as Solidworks, Fusion 360 and Inventor Creo. During my time in startup, I designed a pharmaceutical manufacturing 3D printer that 3D-printed tablets as a drug delivery system. I was fortunate enough to have received a 2021 CPhi Pharma Excellence Award for my lead contribution to the design of the machine and won patents for it.

**My background as a Content Creator:** Absolutely none. I just like writing and creating designs online. Figured I could start sharing some of the things I have worked on and will work on now with the world.

**My background as an Entrepreneur:** Absolutely none. ***See the trend?*** I've gotten entrepreneur experience from watching my father's career as one for almost 20 years. I was also fortunate to work at two startups that exposed to me not just the technical side of things but the business development aspect of a company which quite frankly is converting me from an engineer to a founder instead.

**My two cents that makes sense:** Don't be afraid to start something you know nothing about.

From the words of Sahil Laviniga, writer of ***Minimal Entreprenuer***:
> How to grow - say yes to the things you cannot do.
